# Dynamic Shopping List

## Overview
This is a simple dynamic shopping list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add items to the list through an input field, and each item appears in the list with a delete button to remove it. The input field resets and refocuses after each addition, making it easy to quickly add multiple items.

## Features
- **Add Items**: Enter an item in the input field and click the "Add Item" button (or press "Enter") to add it to the list.
- **Delete Items**: Each list item includes a delete button, allowing users to remove items from the list.
- **Input Reset**: The input field clears and refocuses after each item is added, ready for the next entry.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the shopping list and elements.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for adding and deleting items dynamically.
